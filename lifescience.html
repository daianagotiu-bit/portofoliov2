                            <p>Delivered a web app that both technical and non-technical users can easily navigate, streamlining complex laboratory tasks while enhancing user engagement with visually distinct dark mode. The carousel wizard approach improved workflow efficiency by breaking intricate setups into digestible steps. The bold dark mode shift not only stood out against conventional lab software but also reduced visual fatigue, resulting in increased adoption and improved user experience for power users managing large data sets.</p>

                            <h5>What I Learned & Product Thinking Evolution</h5>
                            
                            <div class="insight-list">
                                <div class="insight-item">
                                    <strong>Progressive disclosure was the key</strong>
                                    <p><strong>The insight:</strong> Early prototypes tried to show all options upfront, overwhelming users. I learned that guiding users through a journey (carousel wizard) felt less intimidating than a single complex form.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Product decision:</strong> Introduced "simple" vs "advanced" mode toggle. 80% of users never touched advanced settings, validating that most wanted quick setup, not customization.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Product design isn't about showing everything, it's about revealing the right thing at the right time.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <strong>Dark mode, aesthetic choice that became business value</strong>
                                    <p><strong>Initial reasoning:</strong> I pushed for dark mode because it looked modern and different from competitors' gray interfaces.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Unexpected win:</strong> User testing revealed scientists who stared at screens for 8+ hours loved it for reducing eye strain. What started as visual differentiation became a genuine usability advantage.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Learning:</strong> Sometimes design intuition hits on real user needs you didn't anticipate. Stay curious about why users respond positively.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="insight-item">
                                    <strong>Technical jargon was unavoidable (and that's okay)</strong>
                                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> I initially tried to "simplify" all technical terms. Docker became "container", instances became "machines."</p>
                                    <p><strong>User pushback:</strong> Power users were confused. They knew the technical terms and wanted to see them. Oversimplification felt patronizing.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Used proper technical terms with tooltips explaining them. Let users grow into the platform rather than dumbing it down.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Product insight:</strong> Know your audience. Life sciences users are smart, they can learn technical concepts if you explain them well. Don't underestimate users.</p>

                                    <strong>Status indicators, the unsung hero</strong>
                                    <p><strong>What worked better than expected:</strong> Simple color coded status dots (green=running, yellow=starting, red=error) on lab cards became the most used feature.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Why it mattered:</strong> Scientists didn't need to dig into details, they could scan the dashboard and instantly know "everything's fine" or "something needs attention."</p>
                                    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Sometimes the smallest UI elements deliver the biggest value. At a glance information reduces cognitive load.</p>

                            <h3>Product Vision & Business Context</h3>
                            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Laboratory experiments relied on manual data entry into paper notebooks and Excel sheets. This created data entry errors, made collaboration difficult, and prevented real-time analysis. Scientists spent 30% of their time on administrative tasks rather than actual research.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Product Opportunity:</strong> Transform the lab from analog to digital. Create a system where experiment data flows directly from instruments to a centralized platform, enabling real-time collaboration, automated analysis, and complete audit trails.</p>

                            <p><strong>Business Impact Goals:</strong> Reduce data entry errors by 90%, decrease time to results by 40%, enable regulatory compliance with complete digital audit trails, and free up 20+ hours per week per scientist for actual research work.</p>

                            <p><strong>User Personas:</strong> Lab technicians (daily data collectors), research scientists (data analyzers), and quality assurance teams (compliance auditors). Mix of tech-savvy younger staff and experienced scientists comfortable with traditional methods.</p>

                            <div class="insight-list">

                                    <strong>The learning curve was steep (for me)</strong>
                                    <p><strong>Reality:</strong> I had zero knowledge of laboratory workflows, chemical elements, or scientific processes. I couldn't design for users whose world I didn't understand.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Shadowed lab technicians for full work days. Watched them conduct experiments, asked "dumb questions," and built mental models of their workflows.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Key learning:</strong> You can't design for users from behind a desk. Real observation beats assumptions every time. This project taught me the value of deep user immersion.</p>
                                </div>
                                
                                <div class="insight-item">
                                    <strong>Change resistance was the real challenge</strong>
                                    <p><strong>The unexpected barrier:</strong> Technical implementation was smooth. User adoption was hard. Senior scientists were attached to paper notebooks, they trusted physical records.</p>
                                    <p><strong>What didn't work:</strong> Emphasizing "efficiency" and "modern workflows." They didn't care about being modern.</p>
                                    <p><strong>What worked:</strong> Framing digital records as "more trustworthy" for regulatory audits and showing how it prevented data loss. Spoke to their values, not ours.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Product lesson:</strong> Feature benefits matter less than whether you're solving a problem users actually feel. Learn to speak their language.</p>

                                    <strong>Moderated usability testing changed everything</strong>
                                    <p><strong>The turning point:</strong> Conducting moderated usability testing with real lab technicians revealed assumptions I'd made that were completely wrong.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> I assumed users would navigate chronologically through experiment steps. They actually jumped around constantly, checking previous steps and making adjustments.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Design change:</strong> Added a persistent navigation sidebar showing all experiment steps, with ability to jump to any step instantly. This became a core feature.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Learning:</strong> This was my first experience with formal usability testing, and it fundamentally changed how I approach design. Watch users struggle equals learn more than any stakeholder meeting.</p>

                                    <p><strong>User need:</strong> They actually cared more about data output, seeing trends, comparing experiments, and spotting anomalies.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Product pivot:</strong> Added visualization dashboards as a follow-up phase. This became more valuable than the input features.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I learned to think about the complete user journey, not just the first interaction. What happens after users enter data matters just as much.</p>
