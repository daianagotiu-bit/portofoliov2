                        <h3>Product Vision & Strategic Context</h3>
                        <p><strong>The Business Challenge:</strong> An enterprise workspace platform serving thousands of internal colleagues across multiple product teams needed to evolve. Users struggled with fragmented search, unclear navigation, and lack of proactive intelligence. The platform worked... but it didn't delight or enable users to work smarter.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Product Vision:</strong> Transform the workspace from a passive tool into an intelligent assistant. Make every interaction feel effortless, where search anticipates needs, feeds surface relevant information automatically, and AI accelerates common workflows without feeling intrusive.</p>

                        <p><strong>Strategic Goals:</strong> Reduce time to information by 50%, increase daily active usage by 30%, establish the platform as the primary entry point for work (not just another tool), and prove AI-enhanced workflows could reduce development cycles by 40%.</p>

                        <p><strong>My Role:</strong> UX/UI Designer working on a cross-functional squad, collaborating with developers, product owners, and product managers to deliver optimal solutions for both business needs and user experience across multiple product teams. Pioneered AI-powered design workflows and conducted extensive user research to validate product decisions.</p>

                        <h3>Why This Project Mattered</h3>
                        <p>This wasn't just about redesigning features, it was about <strong>proving a new way of working.</strong> Could we use AI tools to move faster without sacrificing quality? Could we validate product decisions with research at scale? Could we build features that users actually wanted, not just what stakeholders requested?</p>
                        
                        <p>The answer: yes. But it required challenging assumptions, testing rigorously, and sometimes saying "the data says otherwise" to senior stakeholders.</p>

It's not just a tool, it's a complete shift in how we think about design and development. With Claude, designers can think strategically, prompt precisely, and deliver production ready code. This is what the future of product design looks like."</p>

                                <p><strong>The Revolution:</strong> We didn't just add AI to our existing process, we completely reimagined how product design works. Cross functional collaboration between designers, developers, design ops, and product owners to pioneer a fundamentally new way of working that drops the traditional "move pixels in Figma, handoff to dev" model.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>The Discovery Journey:</strong></p>
                                <p>Initially explored Figma Make for creating interactive prototypes. It was helpful for basic prototyping, but limited. Then I discovered Claude, and everything changed. Claude isn't just better than Figma Make, it's fundamentally more powerful and complex.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>From Figma Make to Claude:</strong> Where Figma Make could create simple prototypes, Claude revolutionized the entire process by enabling:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Generating complete, production ready React components with TypeScript and full type safety</li>
                                    <li>Building entire responsive websites with working functionality and interactive features</li>
                                    <li>Creating accessible UI elements that meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards automatically</li>
                                    <li>Integrating seamlessly with design systems through MCP (Model Context Protocol)</li>
                                    <li>Iterating and refining based on natural language feedback, no design handoff needed</li>
                                    <li>Handling complex business logic, state management, and data flows</li>
                                    <li>Producing Storybook documentation with interaction states and accessibility checks</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>MCP Integration, The Game Changer:</strong> Model Context Protocol connected Claude with our design system, component libraries, and development tools. This wasn't just about AI generating code, it was about Claude understanding our specific standards, tokens, and patterns. Every component Claude creates is automatically compliant with our design system.</p>

                                <p><strong>Why Claude Changes Everything:</strong> Traditional design tools like Figma are for creating static representations of interfaces. Claude creates the actual interface. You describe what you want, Claude builds it. You refine with conversation, Claude updates it. This isn't just faster, it's a completely different paradigm. Designers become builders, not just visualizers.</p>

                                            <strong>Claude workflows, the breakthrough (and the challenges)</strong>
                                            <p><strong>What worked:</strong> Using Claude to transform design concepts into production-ready React components was revolutionary. Reduced handoff time from days to hours.</p>
                                            <p><strong>What was hard:</strong> Getting stakeholders to trust AI-generated code. Had to prove quality through rigorous testing and accessibility audits.</p>
                                            <p><strong>The bigger insight:</strong> Claude doesn't replace designers, it amplifies us. I spent less time on repetitive tasks and more time on strategic decisions. This is where product design is heading.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Honest challenge:</strong> There's a learning curve. I had to learn enough about React and TypeScript to validate Claude's output. Product designers need technical literacy now.</p>
                                        </div>

                                            <strong>We're First Movers</strong>
                                            <p><strong>The reality:</strong> In this company, we dropped the traditional workflow before others even started experimenting. That's both exciting and terrifying.</p>
                                            <p><strong>What that means:</strong> We're writing the playbook as we go, making mistakes, learning, and proving that this new way of working actually delivers better products faster.</p>
                                            <p><strong>The transformation:</strong> I had to learn technical skills I never thought I'd need. I spent nights learning CSS, understanding React component structure, and debugging code. But this is where product design is heading. Claude doesn't replace designers, it elevates us from pixel pushers to strategic builders.</p>

                                </div>

                                <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> We're pioneers in this approach. Most companies still work the old way: design, handoff, dev builds from specs, back and forth, frustration. We've collapsed that entire cycle. Designers think strategically about what to build, use Claude to build it, and deliver working code, all while maintaining quality and accessibility standards.</p>

                                        <strong>Core Insight:</strong> When research revealed that 90% of users typed directly into search without using filters, I didn't just redesign the filters... I asked why users avoided them in the first place. That curiosity led to redesigning the entire information hierarchy to better match mental models. Spotlight Search is effective as a fallback, but not yet a trusted first choice. Typing first dominates, and filters are most valuable as refinement tools.

                                <p><strong>Design solution:</strong> Pioneered a new AI-powered workflow by building components directly in Claude with Storybook, rather than traditional Figma to specs approach. Established proper information hierarchy, improved filter visibility, and designed for post-search refinement as the primary flow while allowing pre-search options for power users.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduced user hesitation by making search more discoverable and filters more intuitive. Developers worked directly from functioning code and specifications, accelerating implementation.</p>

                                            <p><strong>The problem:</strong> "Feed" label created false affordance, users expected it to be clickable/navigable when it was just a label.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Labels that look like buttons cause confusion. Visual hierarchy isn't just about size, it's about affordance signals.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Changed "Feed" from looking like a nav element to clearly being a descriptor. Small change, big impact on clarity.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Users bring expectations from other interfaces. If something looks interactive, it better be interactive. Otherwise, change how it looks.</p>
