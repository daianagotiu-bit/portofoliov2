                <p class="about-lead">
                    I'm a product-focused UX/UI designer with 4+ years shipping digital products across healthcare, fintech, and enterprise SaaS. I specialize in design systems, accessibility, and translating complex workflows into intuitive interfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My background is in visual design. I studied design at university and worked as a graphic designer for more than 3 years, focusing on colour, composition, and the way visuals tell stories. But over time, I found myself wanting to solve deeper problems. Not just making things look good, but making them work beautifully for real people. That curiosity led me to UX/UI and product design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, with over 4 years designing digital experiences across fintech, healthcare, and enterprise platforms, I think about how design drives business growth. I've worked with teams for Roche Diagnostics, Deutsche Bahn, and major enterprise companies, combining deep user understanding with strategic product thinking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm drawn to the intersection of UX and product ownership: where empathy for users guides what we build, not just how we build it. User research informs my product decisions. Accessibility thinking shapes my prioritization. Systems thinking helps me see the bigger picture. I want to own the vision while keeping users at the center.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm excited about AI as a design tool. Claude, vibe coding, Figma Make: these aren't just buzzwords for me. They're how I prototype faster, test smarter, and push ideas further without sacrificing empathy or quality. Based in Cluj-Napoca, I bring both artistic sensibility and strategic thinking to every project. Design should feel effortless, but it's never thoughtless.
