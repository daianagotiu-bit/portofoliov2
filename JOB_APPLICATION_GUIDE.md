## 🌟 Addressing the 5 Traits They Value

### **1. Initiative over instruction**

**CV Examples:**
```
• Pioneered AI-assisted design workflow without being asked—transformed team's 
  design-to-code process
• Identified accessibility gaps across products; proactively audited and 
  documented fixes
• Created standardized notification badge color system after noticing 
  inconsistencies
```

**Portfolio Evidence:**
- AI Workflow tab shows self-initiated innovation
- Accessibility work shows proactive quality improvement

---

### **2. Collaboration over ego**

**CV Examples:**
```
• Work daily with developers in pair-design sessions, providing working code 
  alongside Figma files
• Facilitate cross-functional user story mapping workshops with PMs and engineers
• Iterate designs based on developer feedback about technical feasibility
• Contribute to design critiques, giving and receiving constructive feedback
```

**Portfolio Language:**
✅ "How I work" → "Collaborate across functions" card
- Already emphasizes working with PMs, devs, designers

---

### **3. Curiosity over comfort**

**CV Examples:**
```
• Self-taught AI-assisted design techniques (Claude, MCP integration, vibe coding)
• Asked "why" on MFE Research: validated collapsible panel approach through 
  30-user study rather than assuming
• Continuously learning: Explored Figma Make prototyping to test faster without 
  dev resources
```

**Portfolio Language:**
Add to About section:
```html
<p>
    I'm naturally curious about the "why" behind user behavior. When 90% of users 
    typed directly into search without using filters, I didn't just improve the 
    filters—I asked why users avoided them in the first place. That curiosity led 
    to a redesigned information hierarchy that better matched mental models.
</p>
```

---

### **4. Focus over fluff**

**CV Examples:**
```
• Delivered MFE Research validation (30 users, 2 test rounds) in 4-week sprint
• Prioritized core Feed features over nice-to-have animations to meet launch deadline
• Use analytics to determine which design details matter: refined Copilot clarity 
  after 50% of users showed confusion
```

**Portfolio Evidence:**
✅ "How I work" → "Ship, then iterate" directly addresses this
- Shows you know when to ship vs. when to polish

---

### **5. Clarity over cleverness**

**CV Examples:**
```
• Simplified complex lab workflows into digestible wizard steps (StratoX)
• Chose clear filter labels over creative terminology in Global Search
• Write straightforward component documentation—no jargon, just what developers need
```

**Portfolio Evidence:**
- Clean, clear portfolio language (not overly designed)
- Straightforward project descriptions
- Focuses on outcomes, not process theatrics

---
